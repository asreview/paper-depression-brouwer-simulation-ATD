# Scripts for simulation studies on depression data

This repository contains the scripts for the simulation studies performed on data from the systematic review by [Brouwer et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2019.101773).

The simulation studies have the following characteristics:

1. In the sub-folder `simulation_ATD` the scripts and output can be found for obtaining the hard to find papers using the Average Time to Discovery.

2. In the sub-folder `simulaton_many-models` the scripts and output can be found for comparing thew performance of many different different active learning models.
