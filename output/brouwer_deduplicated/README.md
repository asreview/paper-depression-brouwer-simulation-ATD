In this folder, output of the generate and extract scripts can be found. The output of the generation script can be found in the simulation folder, and the output of the extraction script are located in the currect folder.

`simulation` this folder contains 63 flattened statefiles, as a result of the running the simulation code generated by `scripts\generate_simulation_code.R`. To reduce simulation time, each of the statefiles is run until all inclusions were found, and was then padded to the correct size (the size of the input data). Padding the statefiles has no influence on any recorded metrics, and rerunning the simulations in full will not change the results.

`output\brouwer_deduplicated\recall_and_random.png` and `output\brouwer_deduplicated\recall.png` are the recall curves for the brouwer dataset. These plots visulaize the performance of the simulation algorithms.

`output\brouwer_deduplicated\time_to_discovery.csv` and `output\brouwer_deduplicated\wss_and_rrf_values.csv` contain performance metrics for the brouwer dataset.
